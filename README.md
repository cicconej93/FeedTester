# FeedReader Testing Project

## Description:
This project includes a RSS feed reader application that pulls data from 4 different feeds. 
The purpose of this project was to practice writing tests using the Jasmine testing framework.
I've also included ES6 syntax in this project, to further practice and grow familiarity with the arrow function.
Additionally, asynchronous Javascript was used in several tests. The callback function methodology was used to achieve
the desired asynchronous behavoir in the following test suites:
- Initial Entries
- New Feed Selection

## To run:
To run, this project must be cloned or downloaded. Once this is done, opening index.html will launch the feed reader application
inside the users default browser. A user may select different feeds to pull from by toggling the menu icon and selecting a feed from
the selection.

## To Clone:
To clone this repository to have all files required to run the project, you can quickly run the following git command in terminal:

git clone https://github.com/cicconej93/FeedTester.git

## The Tests:
There are a total of 4 different test suites included in the project. All test suites are located in the feedreader.js file, which
itself is located within /jasmine/spec/
